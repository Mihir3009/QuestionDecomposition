		"context": "The Special Patrol Group (SPG) of the Royal Ulster Constabulary was a tactical reserve of 150 officers which had the role: \"to provide backup in civil commotion, to police sensitive areas at times of confrontation, and to show the flag in a disciplined and impressive way to those who wished to break the peace.\" Formerly known as the Police Reserve Force, the name was changed to Special Patrol Group in 1970 following the Hunt Report and the reforming of the Royal Ulster Constabularly to bring it more into line with othe U.K. Police Forces i.e . It became an UNARMED POLICE SERVICE , which was temporarily armed due to the continued murderous campaign waged upon the men and women of the service , whether armed or unarmed and whether on or off duty and also to avoid confusion between the defunct more militarised Reserve Force and the newly formed RUC Reserve which was recommended in the Hunt Report and consisted of a large number of part time , trained officers to help with security and relieve the hard pressed regular officers of some of the more mundane duties as well as a small number of full time Reserve Constables who were more fully integrated into the regular service . These police reserve officers provided much needed support to the hard pressed regular officers especially in the 1970s when casualties and fatalities among both regular and reserve officers were reaching figures of 2 or 3 officers, on average , being murdered every WEEK . The Special Patrol Groups were formed as mobile support units originally based around police stations in Belfast and with a section ( Orange Section ) in Armagh and it required a minimum length of service and a rigorous interview process before an officer could be accepted into the ranks .These requirements were later dropped most likely due to the need for greater numbers from what was a small pool as the RUC was greatly undermanned to cope with the terrorist campaigns being waged from various so called Loyalist and Republican organizations . Officers in the SPG were called upon to deal with major civil unrest as well as numerous , regular bombings , shootings etc sometimes involving multiple bombs in Belfast city centre and other locations on the same day . In the 1970s the SPG relied heavily on the calibre of its officers as they were poorly equipped , carrying low power Walther pistols and World War 2 , Sterling sub machine guns to defend themselves against terrorists armed with high velocity weapons such as the American Armalite and M1 Carbines as well as RPG Rocket Launchers , various mortar devices and heavy machine guns . They were so disadvantaged as regarded firepower , that , at one stage in the early 70s , members of the Parachute Regiment were assigned to each long wheel base Land Rover to supplement the meagre firepower of 1 or 2 Sterlings in each crew . This was a short term exercise as it gave the \" wrong \" image , not at all in keeping with the aims of the aforementioned Hunt Report . Members of the Royal Military Police were brought in , after the disastrous folly of them trying to patrol staunchly Republican areas such as the Bogside and Creggan in Londonderry , unarmed and in unarmoured cars which were painted white ( to the delight of PIRA Snipers ) which resulted in a number of them being shot . . It was not however until an English Chief Constable , Sir Kenneth Newman , took over that the political correctness was set aside and RUC officers in general and the officers of the Special Patrol Groups in particular , were issued with and trained in the use of more uptodate weapons with which to defend themselves and the law abiding citizens of Northern Ireland . Prior to that the men and women in the SPG in particular had scored many sucesses against the terrorists mainly by their courage and alertness , including intercepting bombs , and preventing numerous gun attacks as well as standing up to hundreds of rioters with little or no protective riot gear ( compared to what we see today ) Colonel Necabettin Ergenekon (born 1926, in Erzurum) is a Turkish Army officer who retired in 1982, having been commander of the Turkish Gendarmerie in Ad\u0131yaman Province after the 1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat. Born \"Necabettin Baltac\u0131\", he changed his name \"some time in the '60s\" to avoid confusion with another person by the same name. At one time, Ergenekon was the commanding officer of Veli K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck. Ergenekon was suspected by later-assassinated state prosecutor Cevat Yurdakul as being behind a string of mysterious deaths in the 70s, but no legal action was ever taken. Nescau is a chocolate brand by Nestl\u00e9 which is only available in Brazil. It was launched in 1932 with the name Nesc\u00e1o. The name is a fusion between Nestl\u00e9 and \"Cac\u00e1o\"(Cacau) , the word for cocoa in Portuguese. In 1954, with the ortographical reforms in Brazil, the name was changed to Nescau to avoid confusion, as people read \"Nesc\u00e1o\" as \"Nesc\u00e3o\". In 1961, the formula was changed. In 1972, the product gained a better solubility and vitamins. Obituary is an American death metal band formed in October 1984 in Tampa, Florida.

His published works include many popular books on games and the more academic volumes \"The Oxford Guide to Card Games\" and \"The Oxford History of Board Games\", both now out of print. Parlett also invented a number of board games, the most successful of which is Hare and Tortoise (1974). The German edition was awarded Spiel des Jahres (Game of the Year) in 1979. The Tale of the Land of Green Ginger is a 1937 book for children by Noel Langley. (Later editions shortened the title to The Land of Green Ginger.) The book is illustrated by Edward Ardizzone. It tells the story of Abu Ali, the son of Aladdin (who is now emperor of China). Abu Ali's first words are \"Button-nosed tortoise\", which immediately mark him out as fated to perform an important task when he grows up. On reaching maturity, Abu Ali duly sets out on his quest (the hero's journey)), has various adventures, and struggles to do good whilst foiling the schemes of the Wicked Princes, Rubdub Ben Thud and Tintac Ping Foo. Hare and Tortoise is a German-style board game designed by David Parlett in 1974 and first published by Intellect Games. In 1978 it was released by Ravensburger in Germany, where the game became a huge hit. It has since sold some 2 million units in at least ten languages, including several known pirated editions.

Metallic dragon is a classification of dragon found in the role playing game \"Dungeons & Dragons\". In this setting metallic dragons are of good alignment. Bahamut is the deity of good-aligned dragons and metallic dragons, and currently the only known Platinum dragon in existence. Metallic dragons have played a large role in D&D's various monster compilation books, and for most of the game's history five main types - brass, copper, bronze, silver, and gold - were presented as roughly analogous to the five types of chromatic dragons. The fourth edition of the game's second \"Monster Manual\" substituted iron and adamantine dragons for brass and bronze, and released the latter dragons in a later book alongside cobalt, mercury, mithral, orium, and steel dragons. The Tortoise and the Hare is an animated short film released on January 5, 1935 by United Artists, produced by Walt Disney and directed by Wilfred Jackson.

Walden Pond is a lake in Concord, Massachusetts in the United States. A famous example of a kettle hole, it was formed by retreating glaciers 10,000\u201312,000 years ago. The pond is protected as part of Walden Pond State Reservation, a 335 acre state park and recreation site managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. The reservation was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962 for its association with the writer Henry David Thoreau (1817\u201362), whose two years living in a cabin on its shore provided the foundation for his most famous work, \"Walden; or, Life in the Woods\". William Tudor (March 28, 1750 \u2013 July 8, 1819) was a wealthy lawyer and leading citizen of Boston. His eldest son William Tudor (1779-1830) became a leading literary figure in Boston.

In the colonial era it was called Wiswall's Pond. Fresh Pond is a reservoir and park in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Rising in the central Lillooet Ranges to the east of the lake, it is approximately 40\u00a0km in length; its main tributary is the Little Silver River. A logging camp at its mouth was once a thriving community named Silver River. The Silver River (Irish: \"Abhainn Airgid\" ) flows from the Slieve Bloom Mountains in the south of County Offaly in central Ireland. The village of Cadamstown, on the river, is home of The Silver River Geological Reserve. Errol Leslie Flynn (20 June 1909 \u2013 14 October 1959) was an Australian-born American actor who achieved fame in Hollywood after 1935. He was known for his romantic swashbuckler roles in Hollywood films, as well as frequent partnerships with Olivia de Havilland. He became a U.S. citizen in 1942. The M-26\u2013Silver River Culvert is a highway bridge located on M-26 over the Silver River in Eagle Harbor Township, Michigan. The Keweenaw County Road Commission built the bridge in 1930; they also built the US 41\u2013Fanny Hooe Creek Bridge and the M-26\u2013Cedar Creek Culvert around the same time. The M-26\u2013Silver River Culvert was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The James River is located in Kimble and Mason counties, in the U.S. state of Texas. The Llano River in Mason County is the location of the mouth of the James River, and it flows southeast for 36\u00bd miles past the Kimble County ghost town of Noxville.

The valleys along the James River became sites for 19th-century European settlements. The river is a destination for outdoor enthusiasts of whitewater kayaking and rafting. Silver River is a 1948 western film directed by Raoul Walsh and starring Errol Flynn and Ann Sheridan. The film is based on a Stephen Longstreet novel. An accidental American is a citizen of a country other than the United States who may also be considered a U.S. citizen under U.S. nationality law but is not aware of having U.S. status, or has only become aware of it recently during adulthood. Accidental Americans' U.S. citizenship arises due to their parents' ties to the United States rather than their own choices: they may be born in their own country but to one U.S. citizen parent who emigrated from the United States, or they may be born in the U.S. to parents residing in the country temporarily for work or study and then return to their own country in their early childhood, with few if any memories of the United States. The term may also sometimes be applied to people who definitely are not U.S. citizens but have some other sort of connection with the country, for example green card holders who moved back to their country of origin and let their green cards expire without formally cancelling their U.S. immigration status, or non-U.S. citizens married to Americans abroad. Such tenuous connections to the United States began to become a more salient issue in the late 2000s due to Internal Revenue Service crackdowns which were ostensibly aimed at tax evaders hiding assets in secrecy jurisdictions but ended up having much broader effects on people with U.S. citizenship who resided in other countries, as well as their families.

The Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP) (Armenian: \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0561\u057f\u0578\u0574\u0561\u0575\u056b\u0576 \u0567\u056c\u0565\u056f\u057f\u0580\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0575\u0561\u0576 ), commonly known as the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant, (Armenian: \u0544\u0565\u056e\u0561\u0574\u0578\u0580\u056b \u0561\u057f\u0578\u0574\u0561\u0575\u056b\u0576 \u0567\u056c\u0565\u056f\u057f\u0580\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0575\u0561\u0576) is the only nuclear power plant in the South Caucasus, which is located only 36 kilometers west of Yerevan, where Metsamor lies; an improper land for agricultural purposes. In common with other early VVER-440 plants but unlike Western LWRs, the ANPP lacks a containment building, which is usually a reinforced concrete or steel structure enclosing a nuclear reactor. The plant supplied approximately 40 percent of Armenia's electricity in 2015. The Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant, also called the \"Crystal River Nuclear Plant\", or simply \"CR-3\", is a closed nuclear power plant located in Crystal River, Florida. The facility is currently being decommissioned and is transitioning to a SAFSTOR condition. The power plant was completed and licensed to operate in December 1976, and operated safely for 33 years until shutdown in September 2009. It was the third plant built as part of the 4700 acre Crystal River Energy Complex (CREC) which contains a single nuclear power plant, while sharing the site with four operational fossil fuel power plants. The nuclear power debate is a long-running controversy about the risks and benefits of using nuclear reactors to generate electricity for civilian purposes. The debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, as more and more reactors were built and came online, and \"reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies\" in some countries. Thereafter, the nuclear industry created jobs, focused on safety and public concerns mostly waned. In the last decade, however, with growing public awareness about climate change and the critical role that carbon dioxide and methane emissions play in causing the heating of the earth's atmosphere, there's been a resurgence in the intensity nuclear power debate once again. Nuclear power advocates and those who are most concerned about climate change point to nuclear power's reliable, emission-free, high-density energy and a generation of young physicists and engineers working to bring a new generation of nuclear technology into existence to replace fossil fuels. On the other hand, skeptics can point to two frightening nuclear accidents, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and subsequently the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, combined with escalating acts of global terrorism, to argue against continuing use of the technology. The debate continues today between those who fear the power of nuclear and those who fear what will happen to the earth if we don't use nuclear power. At the 1963 ground-breaking for what would become the world's largest nuclear power plant, President John F. Kennedy declared that nuclear power was a \"step on the long road to peace,\" and that by using \"science and technology to achieve significant breakthroughs\" that we could \"conserve the resources\" to leave the world in better shape. Yet he also acknowledged that the Atomic Age was a \"dreadful age\" and \"when we broke the atom apart, we changed the history of the world.\" The Siberian Nuclear Power Plant (Sibirskaya Nuclear Power Plant) was built in the city of Seversk (then known as Tomsk-7), Tomsk Oblast. It was the second nuclear power plant in the USSR and the first industrial-scale nuclear power plant in the country (the first NPP, built in Obninsk, had a capacity of only 6 MW). The Jinshan Nuclear Power Plant or Chin Shan Nuclear Power Plant (\u91d1\u5c71\u6838\u80fd\u767c\u96fb\u5ee0), First Nuclear Power Plant (\u7b2c\u4e00\u6838\u80fd\u767c\u96fb\u5ee0 or \u6838\u4e00), is a nuclear power plant in Shimen, New Taipei, Taiwan. Commissioned in 1978 for its first nuclear reactor, the plant is Taiwan's first nuclear power plant as well as Taiwan's smallest nuclear power plant. Yerevan ( , ; Armenian: \u0535\u0580\u0587\u0561\u0576 ] , sometimes spelled Erevan) is the capital and largest city of Armenia as well as one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities. Situated along the Hrazdan River, Yerevan is the administrative, cultural, and industrial center of the country. It has been the capital since 1918, the thirteenth in the history of Armenia, and the seventh located in or around the Ararat plain. The Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant () (formerly Gongliao Nuclear Power Plant and Fourth Nuclear Power Plant, often abbreviated as: ), located nearby Fulong Beach, Gongliao District, New Taipei City, is Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant, consisting of two ABWRs each of 1,300\u00a0MWe net. It is owned by Taiwan Power Company (Taipower). It was intended to be the first of these advanced Generation III reactors built outside Japan. In 2014 construction of the plant was deferred. The Kuosheng Nuclear Power Plant or Guosheng Nuclear Power Plant (\u570b\u8056\u6838\u80fd\u767c\u96fb\u5ee0), Second Nuclear Power Plant (\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6838\u80fd\u767c\u96fb\u5ee0 or \u6838\u4e8c), is a nuclear power plant in Wanli, New Taipei, Taiwan. The plant is currently the largest nuclear power plant in Taiwan, before the opening of the 2,700\u00a0MW Longmen Nuclear Power Plant which is still under construction.",

		"context": "The Yorkshire Terrier is a small dog breed of terrier type, developed during the 19th century in Yorkshire, England, to catch rats in clothing mills. The defining feature of the breed is its maximum size of 7 lb , although some may exceed this and grow up to 15 lb . It is placed in the Toy Terrier section of the Terrier Group by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and in the Toy Group or Companion Group by other kennel clubs, including the American Kennel Club. A popular companion dog, the Yorkshire Terrier has also been part of the development of other breeds, such as the Australian Silky Terrier. It has a grey, black, and tan coat, and the breed's nickname is \"Yorkie\". A breed standard (also called bench standard or the standard) in the dog fancy is a set of guidelines covering specific \"externally observable\" qualities such as \"appearance\", \"movement\", and \"temperament\" for that dog breed. Breed standards are not scientific documents, but are written for each breed by clubs of hobbyists called breed clubs for their own specific requirements. Details and definitions within breed standards for a specific dog breed may vary from breed club to breed club and from country to country. Dog breed standards are similar in form and function to breed standards for other domesticated animals. The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) is a dog breed. It is a medium-sized, solidly-built, intelligent, short-haired dog whose early ancestors came from the British Isles. When compared with the English Staffordshire Bull Terrier (another breed within the type commonly called pit bulls), the American Pit Bull Terrier is larger by margins of 6 - in height and 25 - in weight. The American Pit Bull Terrier varies in size. Males normally are about 18-21 inches (45\u201353\u00a0cm) in height and around 35-60 pounds (15\u201327\u00a0kg) in weight. Females are normally around 17-20 inches (43\u201350\u00a0cm) in height and 30-50 pounds (13\u201322\u00a0kg) in weight. The Lakeland Terrier is a dog breed, which takes its name from its place of origin, the Lake District in England. The dog is a small to mid-size member of the Terrier family. While independent in personality, it interacts well with owners and all family members, and is mostly hypo-allergenic (non shedding). The breed is not widely owned in the United States. The Schapendoes (] ) or Dutch Sheepdog, is a breed of dog originating in the Netherlands. The Schapendoes was originally a herding dog and general farm dog, but today also participates in dog sports such as agility and flyball. The Irish Terrier () is a dog breed from Ireland, one of many breeds of terrier. The Irish Terrier is considered one of the oldest terrier breeds. The Dublin dog show in 1873 was the first to provide a separate class for Irish Terriers. By the 1880s, Irish Terriers were the fourth most popular breed in Ireland and Britain. The American Russell Terrier Club (formerly named the English Jack Russell Terrier Club), founded by JoAnn Stoll in 1995, was the first registry in the United States to maintain the Russell Terrier as a separate breed from the Parson Russell Terrier. The American Jack Russell Terrier Club is affiliated with both the United Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club. The purpose of the early founders was to establish a registry for the perpetuation and development of the Russell Terrier as a pure strain of working Jack Russell Terrier keeping their blood and type pure within the registry to works towards Kennel Club recognition as an official breed in the US. On January 1, 2001, the United Kennel Club recognized the Russell Terrier as an official breed, designating only the stock from the American Russell Terrier Club as Foundation stock for the UKC Russell Terrier. In 2004 the American Russell Terrier Club submitted an official request to include the American Russell Terrier Club stock into the AKC FSS Program to work towards becoming an official breed under the perimeters. On December 8, 2004, the AKC officially accepted the Russell Terrier. The Airedale Terrier (often shortened to \"Airedale\"), also called Bingley Terrier and Waterside Terrier, is a dog breed of the terrier type that originated in the valley (\"dale\") of the River Aire, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is traditionally called the \"King of Terriers\" because it is the largest of the terrier breeds. The Airedale was bred from the Old English Black and Tan Terrier (now extinct), the Bull Terrier, the Otterhound and probably some other Terrier breeds, originally to serve as an all around working farm dog. In Britain this breed has also been used as a war dog, guide dog and police dog. In the United States, this breed has been used to hunt big game, upland birds, and water fowl, and serve in many other working capacities. The Kerry Blue Terrier (also known as the Irish Blue Terrier) () is a breed of dog. Originally bred to control \"vermin\" including rats, rabbits, badgers, foxes, otters and hares, over time the Kerry became a general working dog used for a variety of jobs including herding cattle and sheep, and as a guard dog. Today the Kerry has spread around the world as a companion and working dog. Despite a Kerry Blue winning Crufts (the most important UK dog show) in 2000, it remains an \"unfashionable\" breed, and is distinctly uncommon; however, it not as threatened as some of the other terrier breeds such as Skye Terrier, Sealyham Terrier, and Dandie Dinmont Terrier. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier. Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier. There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier. It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog. It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry. These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs. Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect. Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.",

		"context": "In mathematics, a Cantor space, named for Georg Cantor, is a topological abstraction of the classical Cantor set: a topological space is a Cantor space if it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. In set theory, the topological space 2 is called \"the\" Cantor space. Note that, commonly, 2 is referred to simply as the Cantor set, while the term Cantor space is reserved for the more general construction of \"D\" for a finite set \"D\" and a set \"S\" which might be finite, countable or possibly uncountable. Georg Cantor's first set theory article was published in 1874 and contains the first theorems of transfinite set theory, which studies infinite sets and their properties. One of these theorems is \"Cantor's revolutionary discovery\" that the set of all real numbers is uncountably, rather than countably, infinite. This theorem is proved using Cantor's first uncountability proof, which differs from the more familiar proof using his diagonal argument. The title of the article, \"On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers\" (\"Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen \"), refers to its first theorem: the set of real algebraic numbers is countable. In his work on set theory, Georg Cantor denoted the collection of all cardinal numbers by the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, \u05ea (transliterated as Taf, Tav, or Taw.) As Cantor realized, this collection could not itself have a cardinality, as this would lead to a paradox of the Burali-Forti type. Cantor instead said that it was an \"inconsistent\" collection which was absolutely infinite. In set theory and order theory, the Cantor\u2013Bernstein theorem states that the cardinality of the second type class, the class of countable order types, equals the cardinality of the continuum. It was used by Felix Hausdorff and named by him after Georg Cantor and Felix Bernstein. Cantor constructed a family of countable order types with the cardinality of the continuum, and in his 1901 inaugural dissertation Bernstein proved that such a family can have no higher cardinality. In mathematics, a J\u00f3nsson\u2013Tarski algebra or Cantor algebra is an algebraic structure encoding a bijection from an infinite set \"X\" onto the product \"X\"\u00d7\"X\". They were introduced by . , named them after Georg Cantor because of Cantor's pairing function and Cantor's theorem that an infinite set \"X\" has the same number of elements as \"X\"\u00d7\"X\"; the term \"Cantor algebra\" is also occasionally used to mean the Boolean algebra of all clopen subsets of the Cantor set, or the Boolean algebra of Borel subsets of the reals modulo meager sets (sometimes called the Cohen algebra). In the philosophy of mathematics, specifically the philosophical foundations of set theory, limitation of size is a concept developed by Philip Jourdain and/or Georg Cantor to avoid Cantor's paradox. It identifies certain \"inconsistent multiplicities\", in Cantor's terminology, that cannot be sets because they are \"too large\". In modern terminology these are called proper classes. Yuri Vladimirovich Linnik (Russian: \u042e\u0301\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0301\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041b\u0438\u0301\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a ; January 8, 1915 \u2013 June 30, 1972) was a Soviet mathematician active in number theory, probability theory and mathematical statistics. Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor ( ; ] ; March 3 [O.S. February 19] 1845  \u2013 January 6, 1918) was a German mathematician. He invented set theory, which has become a fundamental theory in mathematics. Cantor established the importance of one-to-one correspondence between the members of two sets, defined infinite and well-ordered sets, and proved that the real numbers are more numerous than the natural numbers. In fact, Cantor's method of proof of this theorem implies the existence of an \"infinity of infinities\". He defined the cardinal and ordinal numbers and their arithmetic. Cantor's work is of great philosophical interest, a fact of which he was well aware. In set theory, the Schr\u00f6der\u2013Bernstein theorem (named after Felix Bernstein and Ernst Schr\u00f6der, also known as Cantor\u2013Bernstein theorem, or Cantor\u2013Schr\u00f6der\u2013Bernstein after Georg Cantor who first published it without proof) states that, if there exist injective functions \"f\" : \"A\" \u2192 \"B\" and \"g\" : \"B\" \u2192 \"A\" between the sets \"A\" and \"B\" , then there exists a bijective function \"h\" : \"A\" \u2192 \"B\" . In terms of the cardinality of the two sets, this means that if |\"A\"|\u00a0\u2264\u00a0|\"B\"| and |\"B\"|\u00a0\u2264\u00a0|\"A\"| , then |\"A\"|\u00a0=\u00a0|\"B\"| ; that is, \"A\" and \"B\" are equipollent. This is a useful feature in the ordering of cardinal numbers. In mathematics, the Smith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set (SVC), fat Cantor set, or \u03b5-Cantor set is an example of a set of points on the real line \u211d that is nowhere dense (in particular it contains no intervals), yet has positive measure. The Smith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set is named after the mathematicians Henry Smith, Vito Volterra and Georg Cantor. The Smith-Volterra-Cantor set is topologically equivalent to the middle-thirds Cantor set.",

In Upper Burma, however, Nyaungyan, viceroy of Ava, had been quietly consolidating his holdings since 1597. Though nominally loyal to Nanda, Nyaungyan provided no support to his overlord. In October 1599, just as Toungoo and Arakanese were laying siege on Pegu, Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo. After Pegu fell, Nyaungyan declared himself king on 25 February 1600. Nyaungyan then systematically reacquired nearer Shan states. He captured Nyaungshwe in February 1601, and the large strategic Shan state of Mone in July 1603, bringing his realm to the border of Siamese Lan Na. In response, Naresuan of Siam marched in early 1605 to attack Mone but died at the border in April after which Siam ceased to be a military concern to Burma. In early 1606, his 7,000-strong forces took Theinni, Thibaw and Momeik but the king died during the campaign on 3 March 1606.",

At first, the Qianlong Emperor envisaged an easy war, and sent in only the Green Standard troops stationed in Yunnan. The Qing invasion came as the majority of Burmese forces were deployed in their latest invasion of Siam. Nonetheless, battle-hardened Burmese troops defeated the first two invasions of 1765-1766 and 1766-1767 at the border. The regional conflict now escalated to a major war that involved military manoeuvres nationwide in both countries. The third invasion  led by the elite Manchu Bannermen nearly succeeded, penetrating deep into central Burma within a few days' march from Ava. But the Bannermen of northern China could not cope with unfamiliar tropical terrains and lethal endemic diseases, and were driven back with heavy losses. After the close-call, Hsinbyushin redeployed his armies from Siam to the Chinese front. The fourth and largest invasion got bogged down at the frontier. With the Qing forces completely encircled, a truce was reached between the field commanders of the two sides in December 1769.",

In late 1852, a large infantry and elephant force marched from Chiang Mai and launched a two-pronged invasion of Kengtung. Burma couldrespond only after the new king Mindon had seized power in February 1853. Because he was still concerned about the British threat, Mindon could only send several thousand infantry troops from the Mone  garrison to relieve the Siamese siege of Kengtung. With the troops by Kenghung sawbwa, the Burmese eventually drove out the Siamese but only after heavy loss of life. In 1854, the largest Siamese invasion force, consisted of Laotian levies, tried once more. But this time, with the British front quiet, the Burmese were ready. Mindon had deployed a larger, well-equipped army . The Siamese forces again reached Kengtung but could not break through. The Siamese forces withdrew to the border in May 1855.",

The line, drawn about 5\u00a0km  west of the Warsaw - Saint Petersburg Railway, was based on the military situation on the ground rather than ethnic composition. Neither Poles nor Lithuanians were content with the line. The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the line as it would require the Polish forces to retreat up to 35\u00a0km . The Lithuanians protested leaving Vilnius and Hrodna under Polish control. As German volunteers were departing from Lithuania and Lithuanian forces were preoccupied with battles against the Soviets in northern Lithuania, Poland mounted an offensive on 100\u00a0km  wide front moving 20-30\u00a0km  deeper into the Lithuanian territory. On July 18, Ferdinand Foch proposed the second demarcation line, known as the Foch Line. It was approved by the Entente on July 26. The Lithuanians were informed about the new line only on August 3.

The ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the ceasefire was put in force in the autumn of 1920, the official treaty ending the war was signed months later, in March 1921. While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict, and only in early 1920 did both sides engage in all-out war, the conflicts that took place in 1920 were an inevitable escalation of fighting that began in earnest a year earlier.

It included locks on both ends of the canal.  The canal was originally proposed in 1798 and after two failed charters (1826 and 1830), construction was started in 1836 by Thomas Butler King.  The project was estimated to cost $450,000.  The canal was finished and opened in 1854; however, by that time the canal was obsolete because of new railroads.  The canal was closed by 1860.  The Columbian mammoth was discovered during the construction of the canal.\n\n The Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal, more commonly called the Delaware Canal, runs for 60 mi parallel to the right bank of the Delaware River from the entry locks near the mouth of the Lehigh River and terminal end of the Lehigh Canal at Easton south to Bristol.  At Easton, which today is the home of The National Canal Museum, the Delaware Canal also connected with the Morris Canal built to carry anthracite coal to energy starved New Jersey industries.  Later, with a crossing-lock constructed at New Hope, the New Hope 'outlet lock' (1847) connected by Cable Ferry to a feeder navigation/canal at Bull's Island along the opposite shore from Lumberville, which ran over 22 mi south along the left bank through Trenton to Bordentown, the west end of the Delaware and Raritan Canal (1834) to New York City via New Brunswick.  as part of the solution to the United States' first energy crisis.  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania built the Delaware canal to feed anthracite stone coal to energy-hungry Philadelphia as part of its transportation infrastructure building plan known as the Main Line of Public Works\u2014a legislative initiative creating a collection of self-reinforcing internal improvements to commercial transportation capabilities.\n\n The Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal between Wrightsville, Pennsylvania, and Havre de Grace, Maryland, at the head of Chesapeake Bay, provided an interstate shipping alternative to 19th-century arks, rafts, and boats plying the difficult waters of the lower Susquehanna River.  Built between 1836 and 1840, it ran 43 mi along the west bank of the river and rendered obsolete an older, shorter canal along the east bank.  Of its total length, 30 mi were in Pennsylvania and 13 mi in Maryland.  Though rivalry between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Baltimore, Maryland, delayed its construction, the finished canal brought increased shipments of coal and other raw materials to both cities from Pennsylvania's interior.  Competition from railroads was a large factor in the canal's decline after 1855.  Canal remnants, including a lock keeper's house, have been preserved in Maryland, and locks 12 and 15 have been preserved in Pennsylvania.  A copy of a detailed survey blueprint of the entire canal system including structures and property ownership details was donated (date unknown) by the Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation to Millersville University (assessed on 10/06/2016 in the MU Archives at Sp.

The survey consists of 67 pages, 98 x 30 cm.  and is undated but the assumption is the original was created while the canal was in use.\n\n The Whitewater Canal, which was built between 1836 and 1847, spanned a distance of seventy-six miles and stretched from Lawrenceburg, Indiana on the Ohio River to Hagerstown, Indiana.\n\n The Washington City Canal operated from 1815 until the mid-1850s in Washington, D.C. The canal connected the Anacostia River, called the \"Eastern Branch\" at that time, to Tiber Creek, the Potomac River, and later the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&O).  The canal fell into disuse in the late 19th century and the city government covered over or filled in various sections.\n\n The Cincinnati and Whitewater Canal Tunnel is a historic yet abandoned canal tunnel in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Ohio.  Located within the village of Cleves near Cincinnati, it was constructed in 1837 as part of the Whitewater Canal system.  Since the canal's closure, it has largely been forgotten, but it has been designated a historic site.\n\n Duck Creek Aqueduct, also known as the Metamora Aqueduct and Whitewater Canal Aqueduct, is a historic aqueduct carrying the Whitewater Canal over Duck Creek in Metamora Township, Franklin County, Indiana.  It is the only surviving covered wood aqueduct in the United States as such it is a form of covered bridge.  It is a single-span Burr through truss aqueduct and measures approximately 90 feet long, 25 feet wide, and 25 feet deep.  The original aqueduct was built between 1839 and 1843.  The present structure was built in 1846, after the original aqueduct was washed out in a flood.  It was strengthened in 1868, and repaired in 1901.  After abandonment and deterioration, the Duck Creek Aqueduct was restored to its present appearance in 1946-1949.\n\n The Whitewater River is a 101 mi southerly flowing right tributary of the Great Miami River in southeastern Indiana and southwestern Ohio in the United States.  It is formed by the confluence of two forks, the West Fork and East Fork.  The name is a misnomer, as there is no true white water on the river.  However, there are many rapids due to the steep gradient present - the river falls an average of 6 ft/mile .  The gradient rendered upstream navigation impossible, and in the mid-nineteenth century resulted in the construction of the Whitewater Canal paralleling the river from north of Connersville, Indiana, to the Ohio River.\n\n Tiber Island was a man-made island in Washington, D.C. formed when the Washington City Canal was dug to connect the stream beds of Tiber Creek and James Creek, creating an island out of an existing peninsula southwest of the Capitol.  The canals have since been filled in, rejoining the island to the mainland.  The Southwest Waterfront, Buzzard Point, National Mall, and L'Enfant Plaza areas were once on the island; at that time, their isolation from \"the mainland\" led to the area's colloquial nickname as \"The Island.\"\n\n Tiber Creek or Tyber Creek is a tributary of the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. In the 19th century it was modified to become part of the Washington City Canal, and subsequently was enclosed in a tunnel.",

He reappeared a year later re-christened as the Angle Man in \"Wonder Woman\" #70, volume 1.  The character was re-imagined in the Bronze Age as a dashing costumed criminal wielding a triangular weapon called the \"angler\" which could warp spatial relationships, phase dimensions and teleport objects and people.\n\n Since her debut in \"All Star Comics\" #8 (December 1941), Diana Prince/Wonder Woman has appeared in a number of formats besides comic books.

The Duke popped up in \"Wonder Woman\", \"Comic Cavalcade\" and \"Sensation Comics\" stories throughout the 1940s and 1950s.  But by the 1960s, when the Silver Age of Comics was in full-swing, he had all but vanished from Wonder Woman's adventures, save for a single appearance in 1964 in \"Wonder Woman\" #148, volume 1.

Maggin, followed by yet another reformulation in 1977 in \"Wonder Woman\" #239-240, written by Gerry Conway.  The Duke made his final Bronze Age appearance in 1979 in \"Wonder Woman\" #254, volume 1.  After DC Comics rebooted its continuity in 1985 (in a publication event known as the Crisis on Infinite Earths), Wonder Woman, her supporting characters and many of her foes, were re-imagined and reintroduced.

It is located between Westport Road in Louisville and KY 22 in Oldham County.  Lake Louisvilla was developed in the 1920s as a summer resort for people living in the city of Louisville.  The state of Kentucky drained the lake in the late 1980s due to safety concerns regarding the stability of a dam.\n\n Casey County is a county located in the U.S. Commonwealth of Kentucky.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 15,955.  Its county seat is Liberty.  The county was formed in 1806 from the western part of Lincoln County and named for Colonel William Casey, a pioneer settler who moved his family to Kentucky in 1779.  It is the only Kentucky county entirely in the Knobs region.  Casey County is home to annual Casey County Apple Festival, and is a prohibition or dry county.  It is considered part of the Appalachian region of Kentucky.\n\n Oldham County is a county located in the commonwealth of Kentucky.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 60,316.  Its county seat is La Grange.  The county is named for Colonel William Oldham.  Oldham County was a prohibition or completely dry county until January 2005 as the result of a 2004 'moist' vote, permitting sales of alcohol in restaurants that seat at least 100 patrons in which 70%+ of total revenue is derived from sales of food.  After a vote in late 2015; Oldham county has become a completely wet county.\n\n Col. John (Johannes) Bowman (17 December 1738 \u2013 May 4, 1784) was an 18th-century American pioneer, colonial militia officer and sheriff, the first appointed in Lincoln County, Kentucky.  In 1781 he also presided as a justice of the peace over the first county court held in Kentucky.

The battle occurred ten months after Lord Cornwallis's famous surrender at Yorktown, which had effectively ended the war in the east.  On a hill next to the Licking River in what is now Robertson County, Kentucky (but was then in Kentucky County, Virginia), a force of about 50 American and Canadian Loyalists along with 300 American Indians ambushed and routed 182 Kentucky militiamen.  It was the last victory for the Loyalists and Natives during the frontier war.\n\n Kentucky County (then alternately spelled Kentucke County) was formed by the Commonwealth of Virginia by dividing Fincastle County into three new counties: Kentucky, Washington, and Montgomery, effective December 31, 1776.

It remains one of the largest massacres in Kentucky state history.  The settlers were traveling southeast from Low Dutch Station to Harrod's Town.  The settler relocation was in part a reaction to British Captain Henry Bird's invasion of Kentucky.  The area immediately east of Low Dutch Station had been overrun with British allied Indians.  Harrod's Town was fortified and a move south would lead the settlers away from Captain Bird's invading army from the north.  The caravan was ambushed in a surprise attack, during the night, after a day's travel of twelve miles.  The exact location of the massacre is not definitively known.  However, it is likely to have occurred at Floyd's Fork and Broad Run.  The caravan was formed by Jacobus Westervelt and consisted of forty-one settlers from ten different families.  Ten of the seventeen settlers killed were members of the Westervelt family.  The victims included men, women, and children.  The Indians responsible for the massacre were allied to the British and received \u20a45 for each victim's scalp cut off and returned to the British authorities.  The Indians were thus awarded \u20a485 by the British for massacring the Dutch settlers.  The Westervelt Massacre had a chilling effect on the region.  A number of settlers from Low Dutch Station joined Colonel George Rogers Clark's militia after the massacre.\n\n Benjamin Logan (c.1742 \u2013 December 11, 1802) was an American pioneer, soldier, and politician from Shelby County, Kentucky.
