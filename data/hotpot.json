It is located on Willis's Plateau at the northern end of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, above Princess Caroline's Battery.  It was named after Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, the eldest daughter of George II.  However, its name is often confused with those of other batteries in the area.  In 1732, guns were first mounted on the battery, which also saw action during the Great Siege of Gibraltar.  Princess Anne's Battery was updated in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with the latter modernisation entailing the installation of four QF 5.25 inch guns with both anti-aircraft and coastal defence capabilities.  The battery was manned into the early 1980s, after which it was decommissioned.  The guns were refurbished in the early twenty-first century, and represent the world's only intact battery of 5.25 inch anti-aircraft guns.

Ibutilide is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent that is indicated for acute cardioconversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter of a recent onset to sinus rhythm.  It exerts its antiarrhythmic effect by induction of slow inward sodium current, which prolongs action potential and refractory period (physiology) of myocardial cells.  Because of its Class III antiarrhythmic activity, there should not be concomitant administration of Class Ia and Class III agents. Tedisamil (3,7-dicyclopropylmethyl-9,9-tetramethylene-3,7-diazabicyclo-3,3,1-nonane) is an experimental class III antiarrhythmic agent currently being investigated for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.  Tedisamil blocks multiple types of potassium channels in the heart resulting in slowed heart rate.  While the effects of tedisamil have been demonstrated in both atrial and ventricular muscle, repolarization is prolonged more efficiently in the atria.  Tedisamil is administered intravenously and has a half-life of approximately 8 \u201313 hours in circulation.  Tedisamil is being developed as an alternative to other antiarrhythmics as incidence of additional arrhythmic events is lower compared to other class III agents.  Tedisamil also has significant anti-ischemic properties and was initially investigated as a potential treatment for angina until its antiarrhythmic effects were discovered.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) is a federal agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, one of the United States federal executive departments.  The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, animal foods & feed and veterinary products.  As of 2017, 3/4th of the FDA budget (approximately $700 million) is funded by the pharmaceutical companies due to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), formerly known as electroshock therapy, and often referred to as shock treatment, is a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced in patients to provide relief from mental disorders.  The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938 and is the only currently used form of shock therapy in psychiatry.  ECT is often used with informed consent as a last line of intervention for major depressive disorder, mania, and catatonia.  ECT machines have been placed in the Class III category (high risk) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1976. Electron cryo-tomography (ECT, also called cryo-electron tomography, cryo-ET or CET) is an imaging technique used to produce high-resolution (~4\u00a0nm) three-dimensional views of samples, typically biological macromolecules and cells.  ECT is a specialized application of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in which samples are imaged as they are tilted, resulting in a series of 2D images that can be combined to produce a 3D reconstruction, similar to a CT scan of the human body.  In contrast to other electron tomography techniques, samples are immobilized in non-crystalline (\u201cvitreous\u201d) ice and imaged under cryogenic conditions (< \u2212150\u00a0\u00b0C), allowing them to be imaged without dehydration or chemical fixation, which could otherwise disrupt or distort biological structures. The Twin Rivers Corrections Center opened in 1984 and is part of the Monroe Correctional Complex facility in Monroe, Washington.  Currently, it is the largest prison in all of Washington State.  It is now referred to as Twin Rivers Unit (TRU).  It currently employs 1200 people.  Monroe Correctional Complex is a Close, Medium, and Minimum security facility, which houses approximately 2800 inmates in five wings, typically two to a cell.  Some inmates with special needs are housed in individual cells.  Inmates are generally required to participate in some kind of program, whether it is educational, treatment, or Class III industries.  Such programs may include earning a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, or sexual offender or chemical dependency treatment.  Class III industries include janitorial, clerical or kitchen work, for example. Lopen Karma Phuntsho (born 1968?)  was born in Ura gewog in the Bumthang district of central Bhutan.  He was born as the third child of Tothchukpo House to his mother who is a scion of Gaden Lam family which traces its origin to Phajo Drukgom Zhigpo, the priest who brought Drukpa Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism to western Bhutan.  Karma learnt basic Chokey alphabets and prayers from his father, who is an incarnate priest and farmer from the Tsakaling Choje family, a religious nobility which claims descent from Bhutan's foremost spiritual saint Pema Lingpa and Tarshong Chukpo house of Ura.  He attended Ura Primary School until Class III.  Because the school did not have Class IV and he was too small to travel, his parents begged the headmaster to keep him in Ura and repeat.  The following year, he travelled to Jakar School with a few friends.  The headmaster at the new school mistakenly put Karma again in Class III.  Karma today humorously claims that he is perhaps the only person who studied in Class III for three years and received first prizes thrice.  Karma spent most of his school winter breaks helping the family cow herder in the neighbouring district of Lhuntse. RT Rail was a small British railway spot-hire company, a subsidiary of Ealing Community Transport (ECT), that specialised in Class 08 shunting locomotives.

Bilateral relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States began in 1933 when full diplomatic relations were established.  Despite the differences between the two countries\u2014an ultraconservative Islamic absolute monarchy, and a secular, democratic republic\u2014the two countries have been allies.  In recent years, the two countries have occasionally been described as having a \"Special Relationship\" with one another.  Former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have close and strong relations with senior members of the Saudi Royal Family. Malawi\u2013Mozambique relations refers to the current and historical relationship between the countries of Malawi and Mozambique.  As Malawi shares a large border with Mozambique, much of the substance of their foreign relations pertain to the border separating the two nations.  Both of the sovereign states have amicably agreed that lacustrine borders on Lake Malawi remain the largest priority between the two countries, as the exploitation of natural resources within the waters of Lake Malawi remain an issue the two countries continue to resolve.  The moment considered an act of generosity and sympathy within the two countries relations is when, during the Mozambique Civil War, Malawi housed over one million Mozambican refugees between 1985 and 1995.  After this gesture, Malawian relations with Mozambique crumbled under the tenure of Bingu wa Mutharika, notoriously reaching a nadir when Malawian police launched a raid into Mozambique's territory. The pulp mill dispute was a dispute between Argentina and Uruguay concerning the construction of pulp mills on the Uruguay River.  The presidents at the time were N\u00e9stor Kirchner (Argentina) and Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez (Uruguay).  As a diplomatic, economic, and public relations conflict between both parties, the dispute has also affected tourism and transportation as well as the otherwise amicable relations between the two countries.  The feud was unprecedented between the two countries, which have shared historical and cultural ties.  Proceedings were brought before the International Court of Justice as a case formally named Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay \"(Argentina v. Uruguay)\".  It ruled that, although Uruguay failed to inform Argentina of the operations, it did not pollute the river, so closing the pulp mill would be unjustified.  The conflict ended in 2010, during the presidencies of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner (Argentina) and Jos\u00e9 Mujica (Uruguay), with the establishment of a joint coordination of the activities in the river. The Reconquest of Angola (Portuguese: \"Reconquista de Angola\" ) (1641-1648) was Portugal's campaign to regain its colony in Angola from the Dutch.  In 1641 Johan Maurits sent an expedition under Admiral Cornelis Jol from Recife in Dutch Brazil to seize the Angolan capital of Luanda.  The Dutch were able to easily capture Luanda in August as the Portuguese forces were occupied inland in a campaign against the Kingdom of Kongo.  The two countries fought to a stalemate over Angola, until in 1648 the governor of Rio de Janeiro and Angola, Salvador de S\u00e1, reached Luanda and finding the port defended by only 50 Dutch troops, regained it for Angola exactly seven years after its loss. Frederick III (Danish: \"Frederik\" ; 18 March 1609 \u2013 9 February 1670) was king of Denmark and Norway from 1648 until his death in 1670.  He also governed under the name Frederick II as diocesan administrator (colloquially referred to as prince-bishop) of the Prince-Bishopric of Verden (1623\u201329 and again 1634\u201344), and the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (1635\u201345). The Sophia Amalia was a ship of the Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy named after Sophia Amalia, the wife of King Frederick III.  The ship was built at Hoved\u00f8en in Christiania under the direction of English shipbuilder James Robbins and was launched in 1650.  She was 51.8 meters long and at that time one of the largest naval vessels in the world.  She was commissioned by King Christian IV specifically to surpass the British ship  .  The ship was manned by a crew of 680 and had an armament of 108 guns, surpassing \"Sovereign of the Seas\" by eight guns. James Robbins, died 1680, was an English shipbuilder in Danish service who built Sophia Amalia and other ships for the Danish navy. Covered interest arbitrage is an arbitrage trading strategy whereby an investor capitalizes on the interest rate differential between two countries by using a forward contract to \"cover\" (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk.  Using forward contracts enables arbitrageurs such as individual investors or banks to make use of the forward premium (or discount) to earn a riskless profit from discrepancies between two countries' interest rates.  The opportunity to earn riskless profits arises from the reality that the interest rate parity condition does not constantly hold.  When spot and forward exchange rate markets are not in a state of equilibrium, investors will no longer be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries and will invest in whichever currency offers a higher rate of return.  Economists have discovered various factors which affect the occurrence of deviations from covered interest rate parity and the fleeting nature of covered interest arbitrage opportunities, such as differing characteristics of assets, varying frequencies of time series data, and the transaction costs associated with arbitrage trading strategies. France\u2013United Kingdom relations are the relations between the governments of the French Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK).  The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex, including conquest, wars, and alliances at various points in history.  The Roman era saw both areas, except Scotland and Northern Ireland, conquered by Rome, whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day, and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas; however, the language barrier remained.  The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history, as well as the English language.  In the medieval period, the countries were often bitter enemies, with both nations' monarchs claiming control over France.  The Hundred Years' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory.  Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815.  After that there were some tensions, but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed, the relationship became better.  Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale, particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II, wherein both countries fought against Germany, and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis.  Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO.  In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship, especially on defence and foreign policy issues; the two countries tend, however, to disagree on a range of other matters, most notably the European Union.  The British press relishes the chance to refer to France and Britain as \"historic rivals\" or emphasize the perceived ever-lasting competition that still opposes the two countries.",

The award is presented by Hayakawa Publishing Corporation in association with the Agatha Christie Society, which is chaired by Mathew Pritchard, the grandson of Agatha Christie. Verdict is a 1958 play by British mystery writer Agatha Christie.  It is unusual for Agatha Christie plays in more than one way: for example, it is an original play, not based on a story or novel; and though there is a murder in the story, it is a melodrama more than a typical 'whodunnit' mystery as the murder takes place on stage. Agatha Christie's Marple is a British ITV television series based on the Miss Marple and other murder mystery novels by Agatha Christie.  It is also known as Marple.  The title character was played by Geraldine McEwan from the first to third series, until her retirement from the role.  She was replaced by Julia McKenzie from the fourth series onwards.  The first six episodes were all adaptations of \"Miss Marple\" novels by Christie.  Subsequent episodes were derived both from works featuring Miss Marple but also Christie novels that did not feature the character. The \"Agatha Christie\" series is a series of adventure games developed by AWE Games and published by The Adventure Company and DreamCatcher Interactive, based on the works of the English mystery writer Agatha Christie. Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan, DBE (\"n\u00e9e\" Miller; 15 September 1890 \u2013 12 January 1976) was an English crime novelist, short story writer and playwright.  She is best known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving around her fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple.  She also wrote the world's longest-running play, a murder mystery, \"The Mousetrap\", and six romances under the name Mary Westmacott.  In 1971 she was elevated to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature. Clement Greenberg ( ), occasionally writing under the pseudonym K. Hardesh (January 16, 1909 \u2013 May 7, 1994), was an American essayist known mainly as an influential visual art critic closely associated with American Modern art of the mid-20th century.  In particular, he is best remembered for his promotion of the abstract expressionist movement and was among the first published critics to praise the work of painter Jackson Pollock. The Body in the Library is a 1984 television film adaptation of Agatha Christie's 1942 detective novel \"The Body in the Library\", which was co-produced by the BBC and the A&E Network.  The film uses an adapted screenplay by T. R. Bowen and was directed by Silvio Narizzano.  Starring Joan Hickson in the title role, it was the first film presented in the British television series \"Miss Marple\" and premiered in three parts from 26 to 28 December 1984 on BBC One.  In the United States the film was first broadcast on 4 January 1986 as a part of PBS's \"Mystery! \".  In his review in \"The New York Times\", critic John J. O'Connor wrote: \"Miss Christie would no doubt approve of Joan Hickson, the veteran British character actress who plays Miss Marple... This BBC/Arts & Entertainment co-production offers an especially good example of Agatha Christie in adaptation.  The characters are nicely realized and the suspense holds.  Miss Hickson is lovely, neither as awesome as Miss Rutherford nor as overly cute as Helen Hayes.  And the supporting cast is admirable, particularly Gwen Watford as Dolly and David Horovitch as Inspector Slack.  As someone notes about the case, 'you'll have to admit it has all the bizarre elements of a cheap thriller.'  Once hooked, you won't be able to turn it off.\" Star Over Bethlehem is an illustrated book of poetry and short stories on a religious theme by crime writer Agatha Christie.  It was published under the name \"Agatha Christie Mallowan\" (whose only other book to be published under this by-line was the 1946 short autobiography \"Come, Tell Me How You Live\").  It was published in the UK by Collins on 1 November 1965 in an edition priced at thirteen shillings and sixpence (13/6) and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in an edition retailing at $4.95.

Stephen Pearcy was said to still be in his Ratt form, indeed his voice was just as compelling. Though his look (shorter hair & no fancy clothes or makeup) was different, his on-stage and off-stage personality was still as exciting. Mike Duda (of W.A.S.P.) would replace Andrews on bass, and was with Pearcy handing out demo CDs just a few weeks after the band's formation. Their first live performance was intense & wonderfully surprising. Pearcy still had it in all the right ways needed for a true rockstar and quality musician.\"Slip of the Lip\" is a song recorded by American heavy metal band Ratt in 1986 from the album \"Dancing Undercover\" and is also on their greatest hits album \"Ratt & Roll 81-91\".

The area's Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil has superior qualities and is free of asphaltic constituents, contains only trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen, and has excellent characteristics for refining into lubricants. The success of drilling for oil at this well led to \"an international search for petroleum, and in many ways eventually changed the way we live.\" There is archaeological evidence that Native Americans harvested \"the oil for medicinal purposes by digging small pits around active seeps and lining them with wood\" at least as far back as 1410 AD. European settlers skimmed the \"oil from the seeps and using the petroleum as a source of lamp fuel and machinery lubrication.\"Desert Victory is a 1943 film produced by the British Ministry of Information, documenting the Allies' North African campaign against Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps.

Libya is considered a highly attractive oil area due to its low cost of oil production (as low as $1 per barrel at some fields in 2002), low sulfur content, being classified as \"sweet crude\" and in its proximity to European markets. Libya's challenge is maintaining production at mature fields, while finding and developing new oil fields.

Genetic analysis revealed that \"Centaurium\" was polyphyletic, made up of plants that could be grouped into four clades. Each became a genus. \"Centaurium\" remained, but it is now limited to the Eurasian species. The Mexican species now belong to genus \"Gyrandra\", and the Mediterranean and Australian plants are in genus \"Schenkia\". The new name \"Zeltnera\" was given to this genus, which contains most of the North American centauries. There are about 25 species.Pothos is a genus of flowering plants in the Araceae family. It is native to China, the Indian Subcontinent, Australia, New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and various islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.Austrobaileyales is an order of flowering plants, consisting of about 100 species of woody plants growing as trees, shrubs and lianas. Perhaps the most familiar species is \"Illicium verum\", from which comes the spice star anise. The order belongs to the group of basal angiosperms, the ANA grade, which diverged earlier from the remaining flowering plants, and, as such, it is the extant group after the Amborellales and Nymphaeales, that is sister to all remaining extant angiosperms outside of the ANA grade. The order includes just three families of flowering plants, the Austrobaileyaceae, a monotypic family containing the sole genus, \"Austrobaileya scandens\", a woody liana, the Schisandraceae, a family of trees, shrubs, or lianas containing essential oils, and the Trimeniaceae, essential oil-bearing trees and lianas.Cyrtandra is a genus of flowering plants containing about 600 species, with more being discovered often, and is thus the largest genus in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, with the centre of diversity in Southeast Asia and the Malesian region. The genus is common, but many species within it are very rare, localized, endangered endemic plants. The species can be difficult to identify because they are highly polymorphic and because they readily hybridize with each other. The plants may be small herbs, vines, shrubs, epiphytes, or trees. The genus is characterized in part by having two stamens, and most species have white flowers, with a few red-, orange-, yellow- and pink-flowered species known. Almost all species live in rainforest habitats.Tibouchina Aubl. is a Neotropical flowering plant genus in Melastomataceae Juss. that contains approximately 240 species.

After the February Revolution of 1917 he joined the newly formed Russian Provisional Government, first as Minister of Justice, then as Minister of War, and after July 1917 as the government's second Minister-Chairman.  A leader of the moderate-socialist Trudoviks faction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, he was also vice-chairman of the powerful Petrograd Soviet.  On 7 November, his government was overthrown by the Lenin-led Bolsheviks in the October Revolution.  He spent the remainder of his life in exile, in Paris and New York City, and worked for the Hoover Institution.

The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs, which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. The Battle of Romanovka was fought in June 1919 during the Russian Civil War.  Russian Bolsheviks of Yakov Triapitsyn launched a surprise attack on an American army camp at Romanovka, Siberia near Vladivostok.  As a result of the engagement, the attacks were repelled.  Romanovka and the Suchan Valley Campaign that followed were the final major engagements of the Russian Civil War involving the United States.  Battles would later break out again between the Americans and Bolsheviks, as well as the Cossacks, on much smaller scales.  Likewise, the Americans were invariably victorious.
